## About

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews, and it also provides a fun way to improve your coding skills. This repository is my personal collection of LeetCode solutions, where you'll find a mix of easy, medium, and hard problems tackled in various programming languages.

## Problems & Solutions

The repository is organized by problem difficulty levels and each problem has its own folder named after the problem number. Inside each folder, you'll find the solution and any related files. Hereâ€™s the structure:

â”œâ”€â”€ Easy\
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 1\
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.c (or .java, .cpp, etc.)\
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md\
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 2\
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.cpp\
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md\
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...\
â”œâ”€â”€ Medium\
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 1\
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.py\
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md\
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 2\
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.java\
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md\
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...\
â”œâ”€â”€ Hard\
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 1\
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.c\
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md\
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 2\
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.py\
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md\
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...



Each difficulty folder (Easy, Medium, Hard) contains subfolders for each problem, named by their problem number on LeetCode. Inside each problem folder, you will find:

- **Solution file:** The main file containing the solution code (`Solution.py`, `Solution.java`, etc.).
- **README.md:** A markdown file with the following details:
  - A brief description of the problem
  - The approach used to solve it
  - Time and space complexity analysis (if applicable)

This structure helps keep everything organized and easy to navigate.

Happy exploring!
